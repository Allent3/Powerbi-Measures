/*
In this measure:
[TotalPerformance] should be replaced with your measure or column that represents the total performance.
'Calendar'[Date] should be replaced with your date column in the Date or Calendar table.
DATESMTD returns a table that contains a column of all dates from the beginning of the month until the maximum date in the specified date column.
DATEADD function shifts the dates returned by DATESMTD by -1 month.
CALCULATE changes the context in which the data is evaluated, in this case, calculating performance for the current month and the previous month.
The VAR keyword is used to store the result of the expressions, making the final return statement cleaner and easier to read.
The result is the subtraction of the previous month's performance from the current month's performance.
This measure will be positive if there's an increase in performance compared to the previous month and negative if there's a decrease.
