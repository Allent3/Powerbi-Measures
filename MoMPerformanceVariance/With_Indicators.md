/* 
In this modified measure:
The Variance variable calculates the difference in performance between the current month and the previous month.
The IF function checks if the variance is positive or negative and prefixes the value with an up (▲) or down (▼) arrow accordingly. If there's no change, it just shows the number.
The FORMAT function is used to convert the numeric variance into text and format it to have two decimal places.
Ensure that you have the proper font support to display these arrow symbols in your reports.
Remember to replace [TotalPerformance] with your actual performance measure or column and 'Calendar'[Date] with your date column in the Date or Calendar table. This measure will now display an up or down arrow followed by the variance value, indicating the direction of the performance change.
